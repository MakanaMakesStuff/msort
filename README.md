# msort ðŸ–¼ 
Please note that when implementing this plugin, your images should preferably share a parent

```
<div class="parent">
    <img src="example.png">
    <img src="example.png">
    <img src="example.png">
<div>
```
Notice the images are not wrapped

If you wish to wrap you images however, you must do so in respect to the grandparent element if wrapped.
This means to style wraps with as absolute and images as fixed 

See solution below for details regarding styling relative to grandparent elements

<b>How to Use</b>
Assuming we are using the example above, we will first create an instance of our Mosaic class and pass our parent element's class as an argument

```let gallery = new Mosaic('.parent'); ```

Then we specify the amount of columns we want and also the amount of padding between images in pixels(defaults to 0 if null)

```gallery.Start(2, 5);```

Make sure the columns do not exceed more than half of the total number of images in your gallery
